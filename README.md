## Hello, I am Yoojin Ko!
I love solving puzzles in the real world. That's how I started learning software engineering and developing applications. 

This page is the overview of projects I have developed. It includes a short description for each project and if you want to know more, please visit the repository by clicking the link.

- [Inventory Tracker App](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/inventory-tracker)</br>
\#django  &nbsp;\#htmx &nbsp;\#SPA

  The project is designed for Python developers who don't want to learn front-end frameworks. The goal is to build a simple inventory tracker application with Django and htmx.

- [Automated Webapp Testing](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/automated-webapp-testing)</br>
\# Javascript \# node.js

  This project is framework for testing web application. UI can be tested with Cypress and API can be tested with Newman(Postman) library

- [Lost Pet Alarms](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/lost-pets-alarms)</br>
\# ETL pipeline &nbsp;\#data_engineering &nbsp;\#search_engine

  Currently, missing/found/stray dog data is scattered on multiple websites with different structures of data. The goal of this project is to create a centralised dataset, which is consisting of dog and location-based data.


- [Game Feature Extraction with NN](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/Game-Feature-Extraction-with-NN)</br>
\#deep_learning

  Game Feature Extraction is predicting game features with deep learning model(CNN, RNN) from raw unconstructed data such as text and images.
